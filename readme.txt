This game was made in 48 hours for full indie game jam 2015

to build the game from source, install SDL2, SDL2_image, and SDL2_mixer, then run
build.sh on linux, or
build.bat on windows

Happy hunting!

Post jam version changes:
Fixed clipping bug in corners
Items and boss patterns are properly randomized, and not tied to the shape of the room they spawned in
Items spawned from enemies time out properly
